lab4c.c
  This program is an extension of lab4b.  It now also supports id, host, and
  port number options.  The host and port number options are used to establish
  a socket connection to the designated server.  The id option is used to
  identify your connection.  If the executable is called as lab4c_tcp it
  establishes a tcp connection to the server and if called as lab4c_tls through
  a tls connection.  Rather than accept commands from stdin, it accepts commands
  through the server socket.  In addition, rather than print to stdout, we print
  to the server.

Makefile
  A makefile to build the programs.  The default option builds the lab4c.c
  program assuming it is on a beaglebone green with he proper libraries.  It
  then creates 2 executable links, lab4c_tcp and lab4c_tls.  The clean option
  deletes all files associated with the project.  The dist option creates a
  tartball of all files needed for this project.

Notes:
  Although the spec does not require it.  I kept and updated the button
  implementation to close the program properly should any unforeseen errors
  occur.
