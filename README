lab0.c:
C file containing code to be compiled.  The program is able to read from stdin
and write to stdout.  All options are optional and include:
  --input filename
    +this option makes filname stdin
  --output filename
    +this option creates filename and makes it stdout
  --segfault
    +this option causes a segfault
  --catch
    +this option catches segfaults
When an invalid option is passed in, the program prints valid options and exits.

Makefile:
The default option compiles compiles lab0.c with options -g, -Wall, and -Wextra
for debugger assistance and error checking.  The check option runs check.sh which
contains the smoketests.  The clean option removes all files created by this
makefile.  The dist option creates a tarball containing the contents needed for
this project.
Smoke-test cases:
  --input thisfileshouldnotexist
    +attempts to take input from a non-existent file
    +exits with code 2
  --input tmpfile --output unwritable_file
    +attempts to output to a file without write permissions
    +exits with code 3
  --badoption
    +attempts to pass in an invalid option
    +exits with code 1
  --input tmpfilein --output tmpfileout --segfault --catch
    +causes a segfault and catches it
    +exits with code 4
  --input tmpfilein --output tmpfileout
    +successfully copies tmpfilein into tmpfileout
    +exits normally with code 0
