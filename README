lab0.c:
C file containing code to be compiled.  The program is able to read from stdin
and write to stdout.  All options are optional and include:
  --input filename
    +this option makes filname stdin
  --output filename
    +this option creates filename and makes it stdout
  --segfault
    +this option causes a segfault
  --catch
    +this option catches segfaults
When an invalid option is passed in, the program prints valid options and exits.

Makefile:
The default option compiles compiles lab0.c with options -g, -Wall, and -Wextra
for debugger assistance and error checking.  The check option runs smoke-tests.
The clean option removes all files created by this makefile.  The dist option
creates a tarball containing the contents needed for this project.
Smoke-test cases:
  balsnd;kjnfk
  adfjadk
  asdfjnaksld
