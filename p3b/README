lab3b.py
  This program reads a ext2 image summary created by lab3a and reports any
  inconsistencies.  If no inconsistencies are found it exits with code 0.  If a
  bogus argument is entered or a system call fails it exits with code 1.  If
  an inconsistency is found it exits with code 2.

Makefile
  A makefile to build the programs.  The default option creates a link to the
  lab3b program and gives it the executable permission.  The dist option
  compressed all content necessary for this project.  The clean option removes
  all content created by this makefile.
