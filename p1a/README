lab1a.c:
C file containing code to be compiled.  This program places the terminal into
non-canonical no echo mode.  This mode can be exited via ctrl-D.  There are two
available options:
  --shell
    The shell option creates a child process which then executes the bash
    program.  Via pipes, we can create a Telnet like connection between the
    two processes.  Inputs from our keyboard and output from the shell program
    are displayed in the terminal.  Ctrl-D signals to child process to end, while
    ctrl-C forces the child process to end.
  --debug
    The debug option enables logging and is useful for debugging.

Makefile:
The default option compiles compiles lab0.c with options -g, -Wall, and -Wextra
for debugger assistance and error checking.  The clean option removes all files
created by this makefile.  The dist option creates a tarball containing the
contents needed for this project.
