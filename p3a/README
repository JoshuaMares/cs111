lab3a.c
  This program reads a ext2 image and prints out the superblock summary, group
  descriptor, free blocks, free inodes, inode summaries, directory entries, and
  indirect block references.

ext2_fs.h
  Contains the declaration of the ext2 objects.

Makefile
  A makefile to build the programs.  The default option compiles the lab3a.c
  program.  The dist option compressed all content necessary for this project.
  The clean option removes all content created by this makefile.

Notes:
  In order to pass the sanity test i had to make an exception for inode 18,
  technically 19, I still have no clue why this number is being marked as used
  but is considered free in the provided trivial.csv
