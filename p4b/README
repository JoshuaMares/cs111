lab4b.c
  This program is designed to run on a beaglebone green wireless with a
  temperature sensor on pin 1 and the button on pin 60.  If logging is enabled,
  every period seconds the program prints the current time followed by the
  temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.  By default, logging is enabled, the
  period is 1 second, and the units of temperature are in Fahrenheit.  However,
  the program is designed to take in various inputs from standard in.  "SCALE=F"
  will change the units outputted to Fahrenheit.  "SCALE=C" will change units to
  Celsius.  "PERIOD=" will set the output period to the number of seconds
  following it.  "STOP" will stop logging temperature reports.  "START" will
  enable temperature reports.  "LOG " will log the line of input, including
  the log command itself.  "OFF" will output and log a time-stamped "SHUTDOWN"
  message and exit.  Pressing the button is equivalent to issueing the OFF
  command.  The program will exit with with value 0 if no issues were
  encountered and with 1 if issues arose.

Makefile
  A makefile to build the programs.  The default option builds the lab4b.c
  program assuming it is on a beaglebone green with he proper libraries.  The
  check option runs the test script that checks the program is working properly.
  The clean option deletes all files associated with the project.  The dist
  option creates a tartball of all files needed for this project.
